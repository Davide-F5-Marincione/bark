An **EXTREMELY FAST** (/s) chess engine built completely as an Attributed Graph Grammar, to be run on [AGG](https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/o.runge/AGG/WWW/agg.html).

I don't recommend trying to run this, as it is extremely slow (2 hours to decide on an opening move, on a normal computer), so just read its description on the pdf instead.
